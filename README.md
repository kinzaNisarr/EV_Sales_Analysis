Analyzing sales drop & email campaigns of Zoom Electric's Sprint e-scooters. Understanding causes & growth patterns.
Electric Vehicle Sales Drop Analysis
This project aims to analyze the sudden decline in sales of Zoom Electric's "Sprint" electric scooters after its initial impressive launch. The analysis focuses on understanding the likely cause of the sales drop and includes two main phases:

Quantifying the Sales Drop:
To gain insight into the extent of the sales drop, the cumulative sales volume of the Sprint scooters is examined over a rolling 7-day period. The analysis uses SQL queries to calculate the change in cumulative sales volume between two consecutive dates, determining the percentage decline. This step is crucial for identifying any potential issues or trends affecting sales.

Comparing Sales Growth:
The project compares the sales growth of the Sprint model with other scooter variants to assess if there is a relationship between the launch date and sales performance in the first two to three weeks. By analyzing sales data of other scooter models launched in the first half of the year and comparing them to Sprint's performance, the project aims to validate the assumption about the impact of the launch date.

Email Campaign Analysis:
The project also includes an analysis of the email marketing campaign for the Sprint scooters. By tracking email sent, open, click, and bounce rates, it aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of the email marketing strategy in engaging potential customers and driving sales.
