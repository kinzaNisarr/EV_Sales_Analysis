Cracking the Electric Vehicle Sales Mystery - Understanding Why Sales Dropped

Project Overview:
Join us on this SQL-based adventure with bluetick.ai as we dive into the mystery behind Zoom Electric's Sprint scooter sales drop. Our mission is to figure out why the sales of the newly launched Sprint scooter suddenly declined and find the factors that might have affected sales.

The Puzzle:
Zoom Electric was thrilled by the impressive sales of the Sprint scooter in the first two weeks after its launch. However, they were puzzled when the sales unexpectedly dropped afterwards. Our quest is to find the missing pieces of this puzzle.

Our Approach:
We will use a step-by-step approach in our investigation:

Quantifying the Sales Drop: We will calculate the decrease in sales volume over a 7-day period to confirm the sales drop.

Comparing Sales Growth: By analyzing sales data of other scooter models, we will see if the launch date had an impact on sales in the first two to three weeks.

Email Campaign Analysis: We will study the email campaign's effect on customer engagement and overall success.

Our Tools:
We will use SQL codes to perform different analyses, such as growth analysis for Sprint scooters, joining sales and products table, and analyzing the email campaign.

Discoveries:
After analyzing the data, we have some exciting findings:

Impressive Start: The Sprint scooter sales had a great start, with remarkable sales during the initial two weeks.

Mysterious Drop: Surprisingly, there was a sudden decline of around 20% in sales after the first two weeks.

Timing Matters: Launching the Sprint scooter in the second half of the year may have influenced the sales growth.

Email Insights: We learned valuable information about the email campaign's impact on customer engagement, click-through rates, and open rates.

Next Steps:
Based on our discoveries, we suggest focusing on the timing of launches, improving marketing campaigns, and considering product enhancements to boost sales.
